### Final conclusions and analysis.

The SVM model gave as an accuracy of 0.55. Its not the best but its slightly better than a flip of a coin.
It failed to predict -1.  We got 0.07 for the -1 and -.71 for 1 in the f1-score.
Overall the model gave us better returns then the Actual Returns.

The LRM gave us an accuracy score of 0.52. With an accuracy score that low, I would not rely on it. 
We were able to predict 1 better than -1. For the f1-score we got 0.37 for -1 and 0.61 for 1.
For the first few years the model was doing a lot better than the actual returns, and then towards the end, the model 
started to preform badly.
Overall the Actual return would have given us a better return.
